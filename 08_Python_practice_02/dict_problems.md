#  Loops on Dictionary with Lists — Practical Coding Use 🧠  

## 🧩 Topic: Finding Majority Element (List + Dictionary Combo)

---

## 🧠 HM Notes / Explanation  

In real coding problems, **dictionaries (hashmaps)** are often used with **lists**  
to count occurrences, store frequency, or map relationships between data.

### 🪄 Idea Behind the Problem
Given a list of integers, find an element that appears **more than N/3 times**.  
If no such element exists, return `-1`.

✅ This is where **dictionary looping** shines — it helps count each element quickly  
without using nested loops (O(n²)).

---

## 💻 Code Example  

```python
# Majority Element Problem 🧮

array = list(map(int, input().split()))  # e.g. input: 3 2 3 2 3
freq = {}        # empty dictionary to store frequency
ans = -1
N = len(array)

# Step 1️⃣: Count frequency of each number
for num in array:
    freq[num] = freq.get(num, 0) + 1     # get() avoids KeyError

# Step 2️⃣: Loop through dictionary to check condition
for value in freq:
    if freq[value] > N // 3:             # majority condition
        ans = value
        break                            # stop once found

print(ans)
```

🖥️ **Example Run:**
```
Input: 3 2 3 2 3
Output: 3
```

## ⚙️ Dry Run / Step-by-Step Execution  

| Step | Element | freq (Dictionary State) | Comment |
|------|----------|--------------------------|----------|
| 1 | 3 | {3:1} | new key created |
| 2 | 2 | {3:1, 2:1} | new key created |
| 3 | 3 | {3:2, 2:1} | 3 count incremented |
| 4 | 2 | {3:2, 2:2} | 2 count incremented |
| 5 | 3 | {3:3, 2:2} | 3 count incremented again |

Now loop over `freq`:  
- `freq[3] = 3` → 3 > 5//3 → ✅ Majority found  
→ `ans = 3`  

Final Output → `3`

## 🔍 Dictionary Usage in This Problem  

| Code Part | Purpose |
|------------|----------|
| `freq = {}` | Empty dict for counting |
| `freq[num] = freq.get(num, 0) + 1` | Counts occurrences safely |
| `for value in freq:` | Loops through all unique numbers |
| `freq[value] > N//3` | Condition check on stored count |

💡 **Notice:**  
The **list** (`array`) gives us data,  
the **dictionary** (`freq`) organizes that data by frequency,  
and **looping** helps us analyze it quickly ⚙️

## 🧮 Alternate Example — Counting Words in a Sentence  

```python
sentence = "python is easy and python is powerful"
words = sentence.split()
word_count = {}

for word in words:
    word_count[word] = word_count.get(word, 0) + 1

for w, c in word_count.items():
    print(f"{w} → {c}")
```

🖥️ Output:
```
python → 2
is → 2
easy → 1
and → 1
powerful → 1
```

## 🎯 Key Takeaways  

- Dictionaries are perfect for **counting and mapping** elements from lists  
- `.get(key, default)` avoids key errors while updating counts  
- Loop through `.items()` for both key & value access  
- Complexity → **O(n)** (super efficient compared to nested loops)  
- Works great for problems like:  
  - Majority Element  
  - Counting Words  
  - Frequency of Characters  
  - Tracking Votes, Ratings, or Occurrences

## 💎 Quick Recap  

| Concept | What It Does | Example |
|----------|----------------|----------|
| `freq = {}` | Creates empty dictionary | `{}` |
| `freq[num] = freq.get(num,0)+1` | Counts how many times `num` appears | `{3:2, 2:1}` |
| `for key, val in freq.items():` | Iterates through dict | `3 → 2` |
| `if freq[key] > N//3:` | Checks condition on counts | Majority check ✅ |
